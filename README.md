 Sample resume created as the first project for the Web Development program at RED Academy in Vancouver.

This project goal was to develop a responsively designed website using a mobile-first approach. Layout was created using floats, rather than Flexbox properties. The site can be viewed online at: http://emclaren.github.io/Website-Project-1
