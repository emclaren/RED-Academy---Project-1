Lorum Ipsum resume created as the first project for the Web Development program at RED Academy in Vancouver.

This project was to develop a responsively designed website using a mobile-first approach. Layout was created using floats, rather than Flexbox properties. The site can be viewed online at this URL: http://emclaren.github.io/RED-Academy---Project-1/
